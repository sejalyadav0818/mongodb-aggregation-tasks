# Mongodb-Aggregation-Tasks

1. **Task: Basic Aggregation Pipeline**

   - Create a Node.js script using Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database.
   - Define a Mongoose schema for a collection (e.g., "products" or "sales").
   - Insert some sample data into the collection.
   - Implement a basic aggregation pipeline to retrieve aggregated results (e.g., total sales, average price, etc.).

2. **Task: Grouping and Projecting**

   - Extend your aggregation pipeline to include a `$group` stage to group data based on a specific field.
   - Use the `$project` stage to reshape the grouped data, selecting and renaming fields as needed.


3. **Task: Sorting and Limiting**

   - Add a `$sort` stage to your pipeline to sort the aggregated results based on a certain criterion.
   - Include a `$limit` stage to limit the number of results returned.

4. **Task: Filtering with Match**

   - Integrate a `$match` stage in your pipeline to filter documents before aggregation.
   - Experiment with different filtering conditions based on your data.

5. **Task: Multiple Aggregation Pipelines**

   - Experiment with chaining multiple aggregation pipelines to perform complex data transformations.
