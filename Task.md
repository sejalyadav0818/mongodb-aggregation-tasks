# Mongodb-Aggregation-Tasks

1. **Task: Basic Aggregation Pipeline**

   - Create a Node.js script using Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database.
   - Define a Mongoose schema for a collection (e.g., "products" or "sales").
   - Insert some sample data into the collection.
   - Implement a basic aggregation pipeline to retrieve aggregated results (e.g., total sales, average price, etc.).

2. **Task: Grouping and Projecting**

   - Extend your aggregation pipeline to include a `$group` stage to group data based on a specific field.
   - Use the `$project` stage to reshape the grouped data, selecting and renaming fields as needed.

3. **Task: Sorting and Limiting**

   - Add a `$sort` stage to your pipeline to sort the aggregated results based on a certain criterion.
   - Include a `$limit` stage to limit the number of results returned.

4. **Task: Filtering with Match**

   - Integrate a `$match` stage in your pipeline to filter documents before aggregation.
   - Experiment with different filtering conditions based on your data.

5. **Task: Date Aggregation**

   - If your data includes date fields, create an aggregation pipeline that groups data by date and calculates aggregated metrics (e.g., daily sales).

6. **Task: Projecting and Calculating Expressions**

   - Use the `$project` stage to calculate new fields based on expressions (e.g., calculate the profit margin as a percentage).

7. **Task: Unwinding Arrays**

   - If your documents contain arrays, implement the `$unwind` stage to flatten the arrays and perform aggregation on the array elements.

8. **Task: Multiple Aggregation Pipelines**

   - Experiment with chaining multiple aggregation pipelines to perform complex data transformations.

9. **Task: Aggregation Middleware in Mongoose**

   - Explore how to use Mongoose middleware to add pre or post-aggregation hooks to your schema.

10. **Task: Error Handling and Logging**
    - Implement error handling in your Node.js script to gracefully handle any errors that may occur during the aggregation process.
    - Use logging to capture relevant information about the aggregation pipeline stages.
